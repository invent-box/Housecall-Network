# Open Healthcare Collection
A collection of open-source healthcare related projects. These projects are listed here by the consent of their creators. If you have questions about a project, or would like to contribute to it, please reach out to them directly.

This collection is organized by the [Invent Box](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRQCzMftIUElX03kHjV4rmQ) team with the goal of empowering _you_ to make a difference in the medical community around the world, and to make it easier for people to see what projects already exist and how far along they are.
